# Sentiment Analysis API

This project provides a sentiment analysis solution that leverages Flask-based APIs for seamless integration with web applications. The API uses pre-trained models such as Logistic Regression and a custom deep learning model, combined with TF-IDF vectorization, to analyze and classify the sentiment of text data.

The dataset used is the preprocessed IMDb dataset, which provides labeled reviews for training and testing. The project includes:
- A Flask API for serving predictions.
- Docker support for containerized deployment.
- A Jupyter notebook for model training and experimentation.

The API is simple to use and enables developers to classify text sentiment into "Positive" or "Negative" categories, making it suitable for applications like customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and more.

## Features
- **Pre-trained Models**: Logistic Regression and deep learning.
- **Tools**: TF-IDF vectorizer and IMDb dataset.
- **Deployment**: Dockerized application for easy scalability and portability.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/predict` - Accepts JSON input to analyze sentiment.
  - `/` - Displays a welcome page with project information.

## Usage
Clone the repository, build the Docker image, and run the Flask API server. Refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/atef2178/sentiment-analysis-api) for more details.
